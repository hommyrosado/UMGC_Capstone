---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- yt-dlp [changed to yt_dlp]
- ffmpeg
- HTML/CSS
- JSON 

TODO:
Added the following [feature/errorLogging] branch:
- ðŸš¨ **URGENT** Implimented the yt-dlp Python API. Had to rewrite application foundation code. All efforts did not allow video downloading.
- âœ… History folder to document history of downloaded videos. This JSON file is read, and if the video in the search results has already been downloaded, then a check mark indicator (or any we deam appropriate) shows in the results. This will help for the creation of a Playlist
- âœ… Sample progress bar or indicator of status. This progress bar shows up in a modal (popup) window that prompts the user to ensure that they "really" want to download the selected video.
- âœ… Error Logging for application side and client side code.
- TODO: Use this error logging for TESTING UAT and API vulnerability risk mitications / Server and Clientside
  - âœ… Backend Logging: Already implemented!
    Errors are logged to logs/backend.log 
    via Pythonâ€™s logging and TimedRotatingFileHandlerapp.
- âœ… Client Logging: Already implemented!
    JavaScript window.onerror sends errors to /log_client_error, which logs to logs/client.log
- âœ… Discalmer review - shows first time (feature/videoDownloadProgressBar)
- âœ… Chrome @media rules test environment for multiple form factors. Dreamweaver also an option. Intellij or Visual Code may have extension.
  See the media_rules_instructions.md file.
  
- Playlist - working
- - NOT SURE? Playlist saving feature for differentiation of downloads (save by user specified groupings) 
  - NOT SURE? create subfolders in designated download folder

- Data file: playlists.json / history: download_history.json / logs: applog
-   All these need to be cleared upon NEW install. Even if this is a web-app, need to identify "New User" vs Returning user.
